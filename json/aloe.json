		"description": "Aloe vera is a medicinal plant, a succulent whose sap has been used to treat sunburn and wounds for centuries. Medicinal value aside, aloe vera is also a great indoor plant. Because the sharp thorns along the margin of the leaves can cut people, the plant is best placed somewhere it canâ€™t be accidentally brushed or fall."
